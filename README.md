# The Bureaucratic Maze
## Designed by John Abbot, Android version by Benjamin Molina

I present a small challenge in the form of a simple maze created by John Abbot some years ago as an interesting way to present a problem to a crowd, which became useful for some conventions and college rallies.
The theoretical base for this challenge is found here (taken from Wayback Machine, the original site seems to be down):

The premise is that you are trying to finish a bureaucratic process, and will be ordered to go from room to room until you can finish the process and be free. The algorithm is easy to code and to understand, so it is a good first challenge for decompiling and trying to figure out how to solve the maze. I have used simple Android elements so the participants don't have to figure out class hierarchies or encrypted data.
